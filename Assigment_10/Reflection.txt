Questions for reflection.
=========================


1. Did you do any online practice questions this week? If yes, which topics did
you look at and why?

no, the assisgemnt was quite large i thought, so i spent most of my time doing that, 
although i did go through some android java videos on youtube to help me get an understanding
of how applications work, which was really helpful.

2. What is one error, bug, or exception that you encountered this week? How did
you go about fixing it? Can you think of a way of making it easier to fix next
time?

I had abit of a brain fade with the drawDrawing method, i had mispelt the variable
so started overthinking the problem to try and fix it, ended up by talking to someone in a
lecturer who was able to point me back ontrack.

3. What is one thing that you did in this assignment that is similar to previous
ones? Was it easier this time? How did you approach doing it?

i would was all of it, the only different aspects was the interface Shape that we used.

4. If you have any other thoughts about the assignment please write them here.
