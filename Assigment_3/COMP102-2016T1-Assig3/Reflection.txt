Questions for reflection.
=========================


1. Did you do any online practice questions this week? If yes, which topics did
you look at and why?

yes i did afew with loops etc, tho as i am away for work i decided to focus mainly on the core content due to being away.

2. What is one error, bug, or exception that you encountered this week? How did
you go about fixing it? Can you think of a way of making it easier to fix next
time? 

I had lots of errors when trying to use the .equals method for some reason, i switched to using .contains which seamed to work better, other wise the 
logic had me abit confused for awhile doing the validator completion task.

3. What is one thing that you did in this assignment that is similar to previous
ones? Was it easier this time? How did you approach doing it?

I gues asking for the user to input the information ie .askString method was similar to the doubles we were using last week. I found working with objects fairly easy in
the second half of the assi tho, i couldnt figure out how to insert the pictures correctly. I know they were showen how to in the Tut but i wasnt able to attend due to work.

4. If you have any other thoughts about the assignment please write them here.
Really enjoyable, it would be great if they could touch on the images thing in the lectures if lots of people had a similar issue. :)
