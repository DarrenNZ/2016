Questions for reflection.
=========================


1. Did you do any online practice questions this week? If yes, which topics did
you look at and why?

NO, ive been using coding bat to build my java skills, otherwise i feel that and the tut exercises are enough work.

2. What is one error, bug, or exception that you encountered this week? How did
you go about fixing it? Can you think of a way of making it easier to fix next
time?

Doing the Arc on the symbol drawer was quite difficlut, i forgot to put in a double and kept on giving me an error for quite awhile untill
i realised why, also the angle and start points of the arc were quite difficult to get my heard around.

3. What is one thing that you did in this assignment that is similar to previous
ones? Was it easier this time? How did you approach doing it?

Nothing, it was different. I did struggle on some parts but i have definatly learnt alot which is great! :)

4. If you have any other thoughts about the assignment please write them here.

I would like to have done the challanges this week but i realsied i had to study for my other subjects.
