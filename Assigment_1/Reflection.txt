Questions for reflection.
=========================


1. Did you do any online practice questions this week? If yes, which topics did
you look at and why?

NO, i have been doing alot of coding bat in preperation for the course tho.

2. What is one error, bug, or exception that you encountered this week? How did
you go about fixing it? Can you think of a way of making it easier to fix next
time?

the .color before the actual color in the assi one got me for quite awhile. But i guess the main thing is proof reading and making sure all the basic things are squared away.

3. What is one thing that you did in this assignment that is similar to previous
ones (for assignment one this can include work you did before starting at Vic)?
Was it easier this time? How did you approach doing it?

4. If you have any other thoughts about the assignment please write them here.

None really, i guess from the info major we did quite abit of mark up languages which i guess when using java to do shapes and colors, is faily similar.
